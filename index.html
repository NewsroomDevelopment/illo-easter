This Easter season, we are divulging the details camouflaged in the most shadowy corners of our illustrators’ pieces that just make “scents.” In the spirit of being nosy—of learning more about the artistic visions and quirks of our team—we picked our illustrators’ brains on the vision and rationale behind the hidden details, images, and references, or “Easter eggs’’ in their illustrations. While these Easter eggs sometimes contain references to the article they accompany, they are also, more often than not, personal to the illustrator or connect to topics that are completely unrelated to Spec. The following selection contains just a few of the hidden details you may have missed within our illustrations. So put on your spec-tacles, and enjoy the hunt! Who “nose” what you might sniff out next? </p> <div class="image width-"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/HSJAJHR6LFA2NOHJRPIB6YALHQ.JPG"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Ji Yoon Sim </p> </div> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/36WJNHE56VFHLKFC26JD2FACQM.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Ji Yoon Sim </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Ji Yoon:</b> This is the illustration for “Columbia Conspiracies: The rats of 114th Street.” In the chaos of the conspiracy board, I added “The Nose” logo, our logo for the Illustrations team at Spectator, and a sticky note that says, “Welcome to the NOSE!” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/spectrum/2022/03/30/columbia-conspiracies-the-rats-of-114th-street/">Columbia Conspiracies: The rats of 114th Street</a> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <br> </p> <div class="image width-"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/YQPFLM6ENRFCZBYFOBTPGLOEYY.jpeg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Liza Evseeva </p> </div> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/W4H7TOW6MJHLJKQNF5DZE4KGMQ.png"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Liza Evseeva </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Liza:</b> When I made this illustration, I was still in the talking stage with my now-boyfriend, who is an economics major.

With that in mind, I also took inspiration from the kitschy designs of Lisa Frank, who draws a lot of cute animals and hearts. These inspirations mainly influenced the color choices and rays of hearts for this Datamatch illustration. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/arts-and-entertainment/2022/03/23/datamatch-did-it-work/">Datamatch: Did it work?</a> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <br> </p> <div class="image width-960px"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/KQ47JY5RZBABHM7OTO2W5NFD4Y.png"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Noelle Hunter </p> </div> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/QB3TU3NQNVDRTPI5BAB2YFVKOM.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Noelle Hunter </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Noelle:</b> One of the contributing factors to the 1968 protests on campus was the proposed construction of a new University gym in Morningside Park, which was nicknamed “Gym Crow” due to its segregation of entrances—the main door served Columbia students, while the “back door” served Harlem residents. For this historical piece, I decided to create a watercolor interpretation of the design. The pathway leading up to the door represents the segregated “back door” entrance, and the stark contrast in facade colors indicates the extent of gym services that were available to Harlem residents—only a small portion of the bottom floor. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2022/02/15/gym-crow-looking-back-on-the-1968-morningside-gym-protests/">‘Gym Crow’: Looking back on the 1968 Morningside Gym protests</a> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <br> </p> <div class="image width-960px"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/Z5ENU2SPNFD4HM634BDMSUHGXQ.png"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Sadia Sharif </p> </div> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/IMYUMIGJ3FGP3FEDDAGCBZ6TUQ.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Sadia Sharif </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Sadia:</b> Sometimes I sneak my friends into illustrations, and I thought they would be fitting for this one representing the types of people in Core Curriculum classes. My friend Kelley is the “Winging It” depiction for always doing well no matter what. Kuang is the “Devil’s Advocate” for being an enemy of professors and students—though he claims he’s respectful and only participates at most three times per class. Duan is “The Recurring Character” for always being everywhere. Ethan is “The Unicorn” for being way too good at everything. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/spectrum/2022/01/28/the-10-personalities-in-every-core-class/">The 10 personalities in every Core class</a> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <br> </p> <div class="image width-960px"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/FXCMRAJJLVHDJB6H24OWQNJMAY.png"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Julian Michaud </p> </div> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/R46FW7TUSVFHPN3PDSC23BISKU.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> Illustration by Julian Michaud </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Julian:</b> I used practice exams from my economics, biology, and electrical engineering classes to create a paper-textured background for an article about midterms and stress culture.
