This Easter season, we are divulging the details camouflaged in the most shadowy corners of our illustrators’ pieces that just make “scents.” In the spirit of being nosy—of learning more about the artistic visions and quirks of our team—we picked our illustrators’ brains on the vision and rationale behind the hidden details, images, and references, or “Easter eggs’’ in their illustrations. While these Easter eggs sometimes contain references to the article they accompany, they are also, more often than not, personal to the illustrator or connect to topics that are completely unrelated to Spec. The following selection contains just a few of the hidden details you may have missed within our illustrations. So put on your spec-tacles, and enjoy the hunt! Who “nose” what you might sniff out next?"

For this historical piece, I decided to create a watercolor interpretation of the design. The pathway leading up to the door represents the segregated “back door” entrance, and the stark contrast in facade colors indicates the extent of gym services that were available to Harlem residents—only a small portion of the bottom floor."
